## Description

Create some UI on the products / promotions page that can be used to load relevant
information from an array. Think about interactivity, microinteractions / transactions, user
experience, etc.

Your team can use a combination of advertisements or promotions and product features.
Create an interactive graphic / icon for each (create at least 3) and load content onto the
page when the user requests that information. Consider scalability and responsive design
considerations for your graphics, and choose your format(s) accordingly.

As an example, consider a “2 for 1” promo. Create a “Click for promo details” button or
graphic; clicking on that graphic should retrieve the content for that promo from an array
and add or replace existing content on the page.

Alternatively, create “hot spots” on your product images and reveal exciting information
about a given feature on a click. As an example, you could reveal information about the
health benefits of beer-scented baby wipes using a clickable graphic overlaid on your
product image.
